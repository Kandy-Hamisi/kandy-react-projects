# React Birthday Reminder App
![banner](https://github.com/Kandy-Hamisi/kandy-react-projects/blob/main/Birthday_reminder/birthday-reminder-app/birthday-reminder.png)

## Why I built this app
- I wanted to sharpen my skills in using the useState() hook.
- To generate confidence in building react applications.
- I currently have a better understaning of:
  - Functional components
  - How to use arrays and objects as props
  - The useState hook and its arguments
  - Array destructuring and object destructuring in React

## Some errors that I was running into
- Failing to return a value while creating functions
- forgetting to place an object prop between curly braces
